        <h1><u>Frequently Asked Questions</u></h1>
        <p class="lead">This section answers common questions about competitive programming.</p>

        <h2>What's the point of Competitive Programming?</h2>
        <p>Competitive programming can help improve your algorithm knowledge and problem-solving skills.
           It is very useful for job interviews and to improve your thinking skills. If you get good at CPPR(Competitive Programming),
           you could probably ace most interviews.
        </p>

        <h2>When should I start?</h2>
        <p>You can start competitive programming at any time, but many people begin in high school or early college years.
           Starting early allows you to develop strong problem-solving skills and familiarity with common algorithms and data structures,
           at an early age which is quite helpful to have competitive programming. However, it's never too late to start.</p>

        <h2>What contests do YOU do?</h2>
        <p>Well, I do many contests, however, my favorites are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Any In-Person Team Contest (CodeQuest, PClassic, etc.)</li>
            <li>USACO</li>
            <li>Codeforces</li>
        </ol>
